        A short story by me:
        <br>
        <br>
        "Nobody-220"
        <br>
        <br>
        the carnival was resurrected as a government building and clowns were now considered employees of the state. you'd never see a clown in spectacles because they all had lasik eye surgery paid for in full and you didn't really see clowns with big swollen feet anymore, either. they all had top-notch podiatrists. the clowns in my sector, for example, all went to the same doctor, stein-2422. it sounds unbelievable, but if you weren't a carnie, you were considered a social pariah. you may as well have been out in the streets screaming like a loon.
one thing you would see a lot of, on the other hand, were clowns smoking cigarettes. that was their favorite past-time, knowing that they could get full coverage if they got cancer or whatever, knowing they'd go to the best facilities in the country. it wasn't rare to see a clown smoke a camel down to the filter, only to grab at his polka-dotted pocket for another. the first time i saw it, i thought it was funny. but just like most things that are funny at first, it began to sting. i couldn't hack it as a clown, which meant i couldn't hack it as a smoker, either. this is the clown privilege i'm always going on about.
they had other positions available besides clown, but that was the most popular entry-level career choice. first-timers were either clowning or shucking peanuts or, if you were in a nepotist disposition, you might be lucky enough to land the coveted position of "elephant rider." this job usually went to a nephew or niece of an upper-division clown, like a head clown. you'd see these little teen boy/girl bodies bouncing around trying to stay steady on a gigantic elephant. much like a mechanical bull, they'd often get thrown off. last year, clown 897's nephew, boswick-2, was fatally injured after being thrown off of phil the elephant. they all have fun, american names, but these elephants are absolute monsters. it's because the real elephants actually went into extinction about a decade ago. these are re-generated elephants, made up of different parts of the animal kingdom, constructed to appear as elephants. they use cgi technology too, so, if the carnival's server is down--no elephants. i think the elephants know that they're really enormous lab rat freaks and i think it makes them angry. 
to apply at your sector's circus, you were encouraged to possess a special skill. but truly, all you needed was a funky hairstyle. if you wrote "my tattoos tell a story"  on your application, you would be hired on the spot. carnies were not then what they once were. they couldn't do much, like breathe fire or swallow swords. their special skill was just that: being "special." unique. i hold the personal, unpopular belief that they were letting anyone with an unusual name wearing a flop hat.
i needed a job badly. i was tired of eating tuna fish sandwiches, as i suspected they were radioactive, considering the price i paid for them at my sector's black market snack bar. i traded tuna fish for sorbie snacks, but quickly grew suspicious of those as well. sorbie snacks are these little ball-shaped meat treats that claim to be from "3 types of animal," though the animals used are not disclosed. i suspected rat, because i noticed my eyes had become beady and appeared to glow in the dark after a few weeks of mass consumption. sorbie snacks were not approved by the FDA, entirely due to the fact that the FDA no longer existed. there was only the carnival and the black market and dick's sporting goods, which is where i had applied to work at.
it is unclear why dick's sporting goods was chosen, out of all america's retailers, to be allowed to reside in our sector. each cityzone got one to three major retail stores, aside from their own carnival, depending on population size. we got a dick's. 
the interview at dick's was conducted by a masked man named doyner. his eyes looked directly into mine, and i noticed he had a 1000 yard stare that suggested he had perhaps done some bad things during his time on earth. doyner ask that when addressing him i instead apply a guttural, unintelligible noise of my choosing, in order to mourn the recent passing of yet another elephant riding nephew, xau-2. i chose the sound: "MMMM," which sounded less like the sound one makes when eating a delicious yogurt, and more like having your mouth stapled shut then trying to rip it apart without using your hands. unfortunately, this wasn't the sound doyner was looking for. he sat so far back in his bean bag that his spine was nearly in a flaccid U-shape, then he shut his eyes. i was worried he was going to fall asleep, which would force me to have to invent a way to wake him up without making either of us feel awkward. doyner shot up suddenly, which startled me and caused me to make a kind of squeaking noise. "that's the noise you should have chosen. i won't be offering you employment at dick's sporting goods today." i started to get up and he stopped me, "one more thing. you are boring. you might want to add something to your look to make you stand out. that could help you get a job. try colored contacts. take care, nobody-220."
i was used to people telling me i was boring. my hair is black-ish brown and i like to keep it short. i like to wear checkered shirts and i carry a briefcase, even though i'm only 20. my father always told me, "dress for success." if he were here today, he would be miserable knowing what that means now. i had no piercings, no tattoos to tell a story with, no physical deformities, perfectly straight teeth and good, clean skin. i was a total freak. i felt the hot, familiar pang of embarrassment pinch my boring, stupid cheeks as i walked away, knowing how my father would look at me if he knew his only son had been rejected from a dick's sporting goods by narcoleptic a man wearing rainbow socks.
i reached in my briefcase for more sorbie snacks. i was on my last one, close to death, with radioactive tuna in my future and no shot at being a clown man. i don't like to complain, but god, i was a loser.
